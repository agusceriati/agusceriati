   <li>👥 I enjoy working in environments where the focus is on people, where there is a desire to develop individuals and provide them with the tools to grow both professionally and personally. I take pleasure in helping others and working in teams. I also believe that communication      is the key to success in any organization or team. I enjoy setting myself constant challenges where I am pushed out of my comfort zone and      can overcome my own limits.

That's why one should always approach them with the right attitude.
